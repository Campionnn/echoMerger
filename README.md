Automatically merge echos in Wuthering Waves and use OCR to determine whether they should be locked or not\

Uses [vgamepad](https://pypi.org/project/vgamepad/#installation) for navigation and Tesseract to read screen\
Will fail for echoes that have a long description and would work better if changed to use some sort of template matching
